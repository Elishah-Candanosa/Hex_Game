## Abstract
This project reimagines the classic *Hex* board game as a digital two-player strategy experience that harnesses computational techniques to simulate intelligent AI gameplay. The game allows players to undertake the challenge of competing against an AI, which is programmed to evaluate winning probabilities using Monte Carlo simulations.

The players compete as Red and Blue to connect their respective sides of the board while navigating the hexagonal grid framework. Players can immerse themselves in a simple yet powerful console depiction of the *Hex* board, ensuring intuitive gameplay with a blend of strategic depth.

The AI leverages probability-driven decision-making and depth-first search capabilities, offering players a tough opponent with no predictable moves. 

## Key Features
* **Player Versus AI Gameplay:** Challenge an advanced Monte Carlo simulation-based AI designed for strategic adaptability.
* **Dynamic Board Size:** Adjustable grid size to increase complexity and enhance replayability.
* **Efficient Search and Placement Algorithms:** Algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) ensure the detection of connections while adhering to logical token placement rules.
* **Concise Board Representation:** A minimalistic command-line display ensures easy readability and efficient game tracking.
* **Winks to Isaac Asimov!**

## Core Components

### AI Behavior
* **Algorithm:** Monte Carlo simulation evaluates all possible moves and predicts the best probable outcome.
* **Randomized Permutations:** Enables unpredictable and adaptable gameplay moves.
  
### Board Logic
* **Hexagonal Board Grid Nature:** Supports complex move interactions.
* **Win Determination:** Tracks player-made connections and validates win conditions dynamically using BFS.

### Game Design
* **Interactive Setup:** Choose grid size and player side (Red/Blue) before starting.
* **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Allows players to alternate moves while the board reflects updated states.

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Environment Setup:**

    Ensure you are running the following on your system:
    * **Compiler:** Any C++ compiler.
    * **Tools:** Console/Terminal for execution, Visual Studio is OK.
